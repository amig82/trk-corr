This repository is dedicated to visualizing data about impact of turkish migrants on Germany's economy, as well as inferring correlation between influx of turkish migrants and increasing business registrations.

Each python file plots respective graphs, the mapping is shown below:

1. mgr-lcl.py -- Surplus of business registrations by migratnts vs total
2. trk-lcl.py -- Surplus of business registratoins by turkish migrants vs all migrants
3. reg-dereg.py -- Visualization of Business registrations and deregistratoins over the years
4. scatter.py -- Correlation between the proportion of working turkish migrants (which has been increasing over the years) and the total surplus of business registrations.

The graphs above show the impact of immigration of turkish nationals and give insight into how likely they are to establish new businesses and contribute to German economy.

To run, following packages are needed:
1. `pandas`
2. `scipy`
3. `matplotlib`
4. `seaborn`
